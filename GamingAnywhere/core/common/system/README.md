# gpa_cpuid module

## Origin

The gpa_cpuid module (specifically files gpu_cpuid.h, gpu_cpuid.cpp and MoreSecureCRuntimeFunctions.h) were imported from the following paths in the Grand Mesa GpaExtensions source tree:
* gpa_extensions/src/libraries/cpuid/
* gpa_extensions/src/MetricsFramework/src/common/include/

## Changes

The minimum number of changes possible were made to the contents of the imported files and to their organization, to make any future syncronization efforts needed easier.
